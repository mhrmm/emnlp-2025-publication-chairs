## Overview of Responsibilities

The Publication Chairs at *CL conferences are responsible or producing the entire proceedings of the conference, including the main conference proceedings, companion volume(s), and workshop proceedings, and then delivering them to the Anthology director. Most of these volumes are actually edited by a separate book chair, responsible for the corresponding event (workshop, demo session, etc.), but the Publication Chairs are responsible for coordinating the whole process. In addition, the pub chairs are normally the book chair for at least the main conference proceedings and companion volume(s).

\
**The following are the main responsibilities of the Publication Chairs:**

**1. Preparation & Cross-Committee Coordination**\
**2. Proceedings Information Collection**\
**3. Finalizing Proceedings Formatting**
